# Trash-Suite for Linux

## Introduction
Almost every programmer at some point, in time has messed up while using the rm or rm-rf command. And the worst part about that command is that it is unforgiving. Everyone tends to make mistakes.
What we need is some sort of system that is forgiving about these mistakes and give us a chance to rectify this mistake. So I have brought you this trash command suite. The idea behind this suite
is to make a trashcan folder which works almost exactly similar to the trash folders on Mac and Windows. Whenever you want to remove any file/folder, you could just use the trash-add command, and 
that handles it, by removing the file/folder and putting it in the trashcan. By doing this, you can make sure that if you remove something, it is not completely lost, instead it gets added to your
trashcan. So you can restore the incorrectly trashed files/folders. This not only gives you the chance of coming back from a mistake, but also provides other wide range of functionalities to 
properly utilize your trash can to the fullest.

## Additional functionalies:
Along with adding to trash, you can restore it using the trash-restore command. Similarly you can also empty the trash can by using the trash-empty function. IF you want to completely remove any 
specifc file or folder, all you need to do is use the trash-remove command. No command-suite could ever be complete without a command that visualizes everything in a neatly formatted way. For this,
I have provided a trash-show command, which helps you visualize the contents of your trash can in a neat, organized manner.
